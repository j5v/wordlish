      <h1>About</h1>
      <p><span class="app-name">Wordlish</span> analyses your text for word frequency, and compares it to the top 6000 most-used words <span class="makeref">[1]</span>, with some re-balancing for fiction. This works best with large bodies of text.</p>
      <p>High 'Relative to Typical' results might not necessarily indicate that you should cull those words, because the 'typical' database corpus might not be aligned to your genre and writing intent. If your text contains dialogue, then characters might be speaking with their own biases.</p>
