# Wordlish
Wordlish as a handy analysis tool for writers and editors.

Use Wordlish to analyse text in your browser, highlighting:
* possible word over-use,
* gender balance,
* words that are particular to some locales an not others (US/UK),
* filter words, which can remove your reader from the action.

# Future direction

Free and open source softare can go anywhere in future.
- I (author) wrote Wordlish to be fast, and do everything at the client browser without sending text to a server. On an old laptop, Wordlish report on _War and Peace_ in a quarter of a second.
- We're looking for other groups of words that writers might want to think about using carefully or not using at all.
